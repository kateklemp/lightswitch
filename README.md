# Project Title

A lightweight HTML5 single-page website using jQuery templating to switch content

### Prerequisities

* A server for local development (I recommend [node.js http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) because it's fast and easy)
* A text editor or your preferred IDE
* A browser that renders Javascript

### Installing

Clone the repo locally, navigate to the repo folder, fire up your web server, view in the browser, edit in your IDE

The initial version has no styling or templating; this is meant to be as bare a repo as possible while still maintaining simple HTML5 standards, semantic elements, and a simple div to switch content out on-click of nav elements.  I have included several pages for demonstration.

## Running the tests

*Coming soonish, not in v0.1.0*

## Deployment

FTP or your choice of deploy process - this is meant to be a vanilla install with all working parts in tact, without a strong opinion about deployment or environment setup
